# The main package manager for Arturo

Here you are going to find a list of all the officially and unofficially available modules, that can be directly installed via arturo.

The full list can be found in the file: `list.art`

## How do I create my own module?

First of all make sure it has the correct structure:

- a `main.art` file
- an `info.art` file with the script's details (version, dependencies, etc)

> ðŸ’¡  If you want to see an example, check out one of the official shared modules, e.g. [the HTML generator module](https://github.com/arturo-lang/art-html-module)

## How do I add it here?

Once you have correctly set up your module, all you have to do is:

- fork this repository
- add an entry to the `list.art` file
- submit a pull request

Once your additions have been reviewed, your new module will be available to the whole world! :)
